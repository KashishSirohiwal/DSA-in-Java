# **DSA in Java**

Hi, I'm Kashish 👋

This repository documents my structured journey of learning and practicing
Data Structures and Algorithms using Java.

The primary focus is on building strong fundamentals, writing clean implementations,
and developing a deep understanding of problem-solving patterns.

## Learning Approach

- Concept-first learning (not pattern memorization)
- Clean and well-structured implementations
- Practice + re-implementation for stronger retention
- Time & space complexity awareness
- Progressive difficulty based growth

## Topics Covered

- Java Fundamentals for DSA
- Time and Space Complexity (Big-O basics)
- Arrays (traversal, two pointers, fundamental problems)
- Recursion
  - Void recursion
  - Return-based recursion
  - Recursion on arrays
- Strings (basic problem solving)

## Practice Platforms

- LeetCode
- Self-implemented fundamental problems

## Upcoming Focus Areas

- Advanced array techniques
- Prefix sum
- Sliding window
- Kadane’s algorithm
- Subarrays and subsequences

**This repository is actively maintained and updated as I progress.**
